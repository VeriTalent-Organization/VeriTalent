This is excellent — well-structured, investor-ready, institution-ready, and very clear on the one pain point, one fix positioning.
Below is a refined, tightened, professionalized version that keeps everything you wrote but improves clarity, flow, structure, and institutional appeal.
I did not add new scope — only strengthened articulation and compactness.
📘 LPI Agent MVP — Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Product Name: LPI Agent (Learning & Performance Intelligence)
Version: MVP v1.0
Prepared For: Institutions (3MTT, Lagos GIPP, SIWES/ITF, Universities, Bootcamps, EdTech Platforms)

Executive Summary
The LPI Agent is a lightweight institutional AI tool that automatically converts student/intern assignments, activity logs, tasks, or reports into weekly summaries, monthly insights, and a final competency signal.
It solves one critical bottleneck across SIWES, internships, and training programs:➡️ The manual review and reporting of high-volume assignment submissions.
Workflow:Institution uploads assignments → AI summarizes → System generates insights → Institution receives standardized outputs.
The MVP is standalone but feeds performance data into the VeriTalent ecosystem for talent intelligence and competency-based scoring.
Problem Statement
Institutions face increasing operational strain caused by:


Large volumes of weekly assignments and activity logs
Limited supervisor bandwidth
No standardized performance tracking
Difficulty generating timely reports
Inconsistent end-of-program evaluation
Lack of objective insights across cohorts

The result: slow processes, low visibility, and uneven assessment quality.
3. MVP Goal (One Pain Point, One Fix)
🚀 Goal: Automate the evaluation and summarization of assignment submissions.
The MVP will:
✔ Accept assignment uploads
✔ Summarize learner achievements
✔ Generate weekly/monthly structured outputs
✔ Produce an end-of-program competency signal

Core components (detailed)
A. Ingestion & Connectors
Purpose: Collect data from external sources (CV uploads, LinkedIn, GitHub, LMS, SFTP, API feeds, institutional DBs).


Adapters / Connectors: OAuth connectors (LinkedIn, Google), API clients (GitHub, Coursera), LMS connectors (Moodle, Canvas), SFTP & CSV importers.
Tech: Python (requests, aiohttp), Celery tasks or Kafka producers.
Output: Raw documents/files + structured metadata into Object Storage (S3/Blob) and a message into a queue (Kafka/RabbitMQ).

Notes: Use rate-limiting, retry logic, incremental sync (since_id, updated_at), and scoped OAuth tokens.
B. Raw Storage & Message Queue

Raw Storage: S3 / Azure Blob for documents, attachments, logs.
Queue: Kafka (high throughput) or RabbitMQ for task orchestration.
Why: Decouples ingestion from processing; supports bulk uploads and backpressure.

C. Preprocessing & Extraction (ETL)
Tasks:

Document OCR (Tesseract or AWS Textract) where needed.
Text extraction (pdfminer, tika).
CV parsing (custom parser + regex + ML-based parser).
Normalization (dates, locations, role titles).
Metadata enrichment (geolocation, org mapping).

Tech: Python ETL workers, Spark for large batch workloads (if needed), or Dask.
D. Feature Store & Embeddings (Vector DB)
Purpose: Store computed features and semantic vectors for fast retrieval and similarity.

Feature Store: Feast or custom Postgres/Mongo store for tabular features (experience_years, skill counts, verified_refs_count).
Vector DB: Pinecone / Weaviate / Milvus / Chroma for embeddings (CV text, project descriptions, reference snippets).
Embeddings: OpenAI embeddings or Hugging Face sentence-transformers.

Why: Fast semantic search, candidate-job similarity, nearest-neighbor queries for competency matching.
E. ML / NLP & Model Serving
Subsystems:

Parsing & NER — extract roles, companies, responsibilities, achievements. (spaCy, HuggingFace)
Skill Extraction & Mapping — map text tokens to canonical skills (SFIA/LinkedIn taxonomy).
Embeddings Service — compute & store vectors for each artifact.
Classifier Models — detect skill level signals, submission quality, plagiarism flags.
LLM-based Reasoning — generate summaries, growth recommendations, human-readable competency explanations (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, local LLMs).
Scoring Engines — Fit-Score model (gradient booster or neural ranker), LPI competency scoring (feature-based + model).

Model Serving: FastAPI or TorchServe; batch jobs via Airflow/Celery for heavy workloads. Use GPUs for embedding/LLM inference.
F. Competency Mapping Layer
Function: Convert activity signals to competency measurements using a mapping to recognized frameworks (SFIA, custom taxonomy).

Rule-based + ML hybrid: e.g., if commits > X & PR acceptance rate > Y → software engineering competency strong.
Weighting engine: combine evidence from CV, project artefacts, references, course completions, supervisor ratings.

Output: per-skill score (0–100), categorical level (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced/Expert).
G. Summarization & Report Generation (LPI)
Produce:

Weekly summaries (short bullet points)
Monthly trend reports (charts + narratives)
Final competency signal + confidence score

Tech: LLM prompts + templates, Chart generation (Plotly), PDF renderer (WeasyPrint, Puppeteer).
Human-in-loop: allow supervisors to edit/approve generated summaries before finalizing.
H. Fit-Scoring Engine
Function: Score candidate against a role using:

Required skills vector
Competency scores
Verified references weight
Behavioral/consistency signals

Model Types: Logistic Regression / XGBoost or neural ranker (Siamese networks over embeddings).
Explainability: Provide per-feature contribution (SHAP) and human-readable reasons.
I. Decision Layer & Explainability

Explainability module: SHAP/ELI5 outputs, LLM-based causal text explaining score.
Audit logs: store inputs used for each decision.
Human override: UI for recruiters/instructors to adjust weights and re-run scores.

J. Insights Store & API Layer

Insights Store: Postgres (structured outputs), MongoDB (semi-structured), and vector DB references.
APIs: FastAPI / GraphQL endpoints for:

  * Get candidate competency signals
  * Get role-fit scores
  * Request weekly/monthly LPI reports
  * Push data to VeriTalent Card
  * Webhooks for completed reports

5) Infra & deployment recommendations
Cloud

Primary: Azure (fits your earlier notes) or AWS/GCP.
Storage: Azure Blob / AWS S3 for raw files.
Compute: Kubernetes (AKS/EKS/GKE) for microservices & model serving.
GPUs: Use dedicated GPU nodes for embedding/LLM inference (NVIDIA A100/V100 or cloud equivalents).
Serverless: Use Functions / Lambdas for light async tasks (email/webhooks).

Data Stores

Postgres for transactional data (users, roles, tokens).
MongoDB for unstructured insights and LPI outputs (or use Postgres JSONB).
Redis for caching & rate-limit counters.
Vector DB (Pinecone / Weaviate / Milvus) for embeddings.
Feature Store: Feast or in-house PostgreSQL.

Messaging & Orchestration

Kafka for high-throughput ingestion and event stream.
Airflow for complex ETL & scheduled workflows.
Celery/Bull for background tasks.

CI/CD & Infra as Code

GitHub Actions / Azure DevOps
Terraform for infra


Security & Compliance


Encryption: TLS in transit; AES-256 at rest.
Identity: OAuth2 + OpenID Connect; enterprise SSO (SAML) for institutions.
RBAC & Scopes: enforce fine-grained permissions (auditing).
Key Management: Azure Key Vault / AWS KMS.
Audit Trails: Immutable logs for all model outputs & verification actions.
Data Residency: support region selection for institutional compliance (EU, NG).
DPA / GDPR / NDPR: ensure contractual and technical safeguards for processors.


Observability & Monitoring


Metrics: Prometheus + Grafana (latency, error rates, queue depth).
Logging: ELK (Elastic) or cloud logging (Azure Monitor).
Tracing: OpenTelemetry for distributed traces.
Model Monitoring: drift detection, input distribution changes, performance regression alerts.
Alerting: PagerDuty / Opsgenie for critical failures.


Explainability & Human-in-the-loop


Explainability outputs: SHAP values per prediction, human-readable reasoning from LLM.
Review UI: Supervisors can accept / edit auto-generated reports before publishing to learners.
Feedback loop: Supervisor edits and corrections feed back into training data (label store).


Scale, Cost & Performance considerations


Embeddings & LLM usage: cost can grow quickly; use caching for repeated requests, batch embeddings, and hybrid local + API approach (local models for cheaper inference).
Tokenization & batching: batch inference for bulk uploads; set reasonable SLAs for LPI processing (1–5 minutes for single item; bulk 1000 items processed in parallel).
Autoscaling: GPU clusters auto-scale for peak loads (e.g., bulk upload windows from institutions).

Developer & Data Contracts (quick checklist)


Version models & feature schema in model registry (MLflow).
Store training data lineage for auditability (Data Catalog).
Contract tests for connectors (schema/fields).
API spec in OpenAPI/Swagger.
CI tests for model performance & accuracy before deployment.

Final notes / recommendation

Start with a hybrid approach: use hosted LLM/embedding APIs for fast iteration, but plan to move core workloads to local or cheaper inference (huggingface + GPU) to control cost at scale.
Prioritize explainability, audit logging, and institutional control — these are critical for adoption by universities and government bodies.
Build the human-in-loop early: institutions will trust outputs more if there is supervisor review and edit capability.

If you want, I can next:

Produce a detailed sequence diagram for a single candidate flow (ingest → competency → fit score → VeriTalent Card).
Create OpenAPI spec for the intelligence layer endpoints.
Draft data schema definitions for the competency signal and fit-score outputs as JSON Schema.
